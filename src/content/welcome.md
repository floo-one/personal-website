        <h1>Welcome to My Personal Website</h1>
        <p>Hi, I'm [Your Name], a 22-year-old from Germany. This website was created as part of my journey to learn basic web development with 11ty. Here, you'll find information about my current projects and interests.</p>
        <p>I love traveling, computers, artificial intelligence, and process automation. Six months ago, I started my entrepreneurial journey with a digital marketing agency. I also maintain a blog where I share my experiences and projects.</p>
        <p>I enjoy programming random tools, creating websites, and automating different processes with n8n. Feel free to explore my projects and learn more about what I'm working on.</p>
